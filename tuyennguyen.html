<p>Hello! My name is Tuyen Nguyen. I go by Tuyen (Too-win). This is my second year at
 <strong>North Seattle College</strong>. After many years away from school, I've decided to go back to 
 school to get a <em>Degree in Application Development.</em> I first learned to 
 code back in 2015 when I was in high school. Despite being very interested in coding,
 I was super inconsistent with it. 

</p>
<p>In my free time, I like to go to the gym and bake. My web-page's background image
is Omori - a game I've been obsessed with recently. It's a very exciting Indie game and full of mysteries. At first,
it appears to be very light-hearted on the surface but it graduatally turns darker and reveals its dark understones.
I also enjoy eating out and my favorite food is sushi.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature
     from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, 
     looked up one of the more obscure Latin words.
     <br><br>Consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
      word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de 
      Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory 
      of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
